# SudokuGenerator
Java program that generates a random sudoku puzzle graphic using an algorithm in realtime. 
User can input the size of the grid as well as the speed at which the program will run, Useful for visualizing recursive algoritms.
The speed of the program is the number of milliseconds the algorithm will pause between changes in the puzzle(Each time the recursive method is called)
The number of squares left filled after generation is equal to 25% of the total grid(A standard sized puzzle will have 20 filled squares)
